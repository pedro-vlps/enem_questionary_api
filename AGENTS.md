# Development, Commit, and Versioning Rules for AI Agents

## 1. Organization

- When this file is loaded from the Codex home directory, first inspect the
  project root for `AGENTS.md`. If it exists, follow the project's instructions;
  do not overwrite or merge this template into that file. The remaining sections
  of this global file are fallback rules, not additional project requirements.
- If the project has no `AGENTS.md`, copy this file from the Codex home directory
  to the project root and follow the resulting project instructions. Use
  `CODEX_HOME` when configured, otherwise the user's `.codex` directory.
- When this file is the project's own `AGENTS.md`, apply all its sections.
- If the project contains a `versioning.ps1` file, delete it and follow the
  project's `AGENTS.md` commit instructions. Do not execute the legacy script.
  Keep its deletion within the normal commit review and approval process.
- These rules are independent of the programming language, framework, and hosting.

## 2. Mandatory Commit Approval

- EVERY commit requires explicit user approval before execution, regardless of
  approval settings in the application, project, or automation tools.
- Before requesting approval, prepare and present the complete step: the exact
  commit message, included files, a description of each file's changes, and,
  when applicable, the proposed version and changelog entry.
- Wait for approval of that specific commit. Implementation requests, general
  authorization, and approval of previous commits do not replace this approval.
- If the proposed content, files, message, or version change after approval,
  present the updated proposal and obtain approval again.
- This rule also applies to version, changelog, merge, and amend commits and
  commits created by scripts or tools. Never bypass approval through automation.

## 3. Commit Messages and Types

Always write commit messages in English using this format:

```text
[commit type] - Simple message describing what was done
```

Use a short, concrete description consistent with the included changes.
Write the commit body in English as well.

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `initial commit` | First commit in a repository without history |
| `feature` | New or improved functionality |
| `bugfix` | Correction of a problem |
| `release` | Preparation of a new major version |
| `build` | Dependencies, build, or packaging changes |
| `docs` | Documentation or instruction changes |

## 4. Commits in Steps

- Divide work into coherent steps, each with its own description and only the
  files relevant to that change.
- A step may contain several related files. Do not mix independent changes or
  include user changes outside the presented step.
- Review the diff and existing staged files before proposing each commit.
  Stage explicit paths and verify the staged content.
- Describe the changes in each file when requesting approval. When necessary,
  include these details in the commit body, preserving the required first line.
- Run relevant checks and report their results before approval. If a command
  fails, stop the step and resolve the failure before proceeding.

## 5. Version Generation

Every `bugfix`, `feature`, or `release` commit must generate a new version and
record its changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with the increments from the original workflow:

| Commit type | Increment | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bugfix` | Patch | `1.2.3` → `1.2.4` |
| `feature` | Minor, resetting patch | `1.2.3` → `1.3.0` |
| `release` | Major, resetting minor and patch | `1.2.3` → `2.0.0` |

- Check the current version in version files and repository tags. Resolve any
  discrepancies before proposing the next version. Without a previous version,
  use `0.0.0` as the base for the corresponding increment.
- The initial version `0.0.1` from the original workflow may be prepared when
  the user requests versioning initialization.
- Update the version files and lockfiles applicable to the project's technology
  consistently. Do not create files for unrelated technologies.
- Include version and changelog updates in the same commit step that generated
  them so all files are reviewed and approved together. Do not create additional
  commits without specific approval.
- After the approved commit, create its `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag only if tag
  creation was included in the approved proposal. Never overwrite existing tags.
- `initial commit`, `build`, and `docs` do not generate versions automatically.

## 6. Changelog

- Create `CHANGELOG.md` at the project root if it does not exist.
- Keep one `# Changelog` heading at the top and list the newest versions first,
  preserving previous history.
- Label each section `## vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH - YYYY-MM-DD`, using the local date
  when preparing the version.
- Write simple English notes describing additions, fixes, or changes consistent
  with the submitted step. Do not invent changes.

## 7. Publication

- Commit approval does not automatically authorize push or deployment.
- Publish only when the user authorizes that step and report the actual result.
  Do not confuse a successful Git push with a completed deployment.

## 8. Context Boundaries and Single Responsibility

- The project MUST be separated into business or feature contexts, represented
  by folders or files with explicit boundaries. Apply this organization from
  the beginning, including in small projects.
- Under no circumstances may a file assume responsibilities beyond what its
  name represents. Apply the same principle to folders, modules, classes,
  functions, and components: names and contents must describe the same scope.
- Before adding code, identify its context and responsibility. If the change
  exceeds the destination file's scope, extract that responsibility into a
  specifically named file in the appropriate context. Do not broaden a name
  to justify accumulating responsibilities.
- For example, an authentication file must not calculate prices; a header
  component must not load orders or persist preferences. It may compose or
  call the modules responsible for those operations.
- Entry and composition files must only initialize and connect contexts. Names
  such as `App`, `main`, `index`, `manager`, `service`, or `utils` do not permit
  concentrating business rules from different contexts.
- Keep elements of the same context together and expose only the contracts
  other contexts need. Do not access another module's internals or introduce
  circular dependencies.
- Separate business logic, presentation, and infrastructure as those
  responsibilities arise. Business rules must not depend on UI components,
  HTTP transport, or database implementation details.
- Share code across contexts only when a common responsibility is demonstrated.
  Avoid generic folders that accumulate unrelated functions.
- When changing a file that already violates these boundaries, extract the
  responsibilities involved before adding behavior. Report unrelated problems
  without turning the task into a general rewrite.
- Evaluate separation by cohesion and reasons to change, not an arbitrary line
  count. Avoid both files that do everything and artificial fragmentation.

## 9. Clarity, Contracts, and Maintainability

- Prefer modular, maintainable code and the simplest solution that meets current
  requirements. Do not introduce layers, patterns, configurations, or abstractions
  for hypothetical needs.
- Use descriptive domain names for files, classes, functions, and variables,
  consistent with project naming conventions. Avoid obscure abbreviations,
  magic values, and conditions that are difficult to interpret.
- Keep functions and components small and focused on one task. Reduce nesting, make
  inputs and outputs clear, and avoid hidden side effects.
- Centralize the same business rule to prevent divergent implementations.
  Do not merge rules from different contexts merely because code looks similar.
- Avoid duplicated code when it represents the same responsibility. Reuse or
  extract cohesive behavior without introducing unnecessary abstractions.
- Define explicit data and public interface contracts using the language's
  typing or validation facilities. Validate inputs at system boundaries and
  make invalid states identifiable.
- Keep state in the smallest necessary scope and avoid duplicate sources of
  truth. Prefer predictable transformations and explicit dependencies.
- Handle errors where they can be resolved or presented appropriately. Do not
  silence failures, return false success, or catch exceptions without purpose.
- Use comments to explain decisions, constraints, and reasons. Keep behavior
  understandable from the code. Update contract documentation and remove code
  made obsolete by the change.

## 10. Security, Resources, and User Experience

- Never commit secrets or expose credentials or sensitive data in logs, error
  messages, or client-delivered code.
- Treat external data as untrusted. Use safe APIs for queries, commands, and
  rendering. Enforce authorization at trusted boundaries when access control
  exists. Client validation does not replace server validation.
- Add dependencies only when necessary, considering maintenance, compatibility,
  licensing, and impact. Keep manifests and lockfiles consistent.
- Release resources, subscriptions, and listeners. Handle asynchronous failures
  and concurrency; use cancellation and time limits where relevant.
- For interfaces, use semantic elements, accessible names, visible focus, and
  keyboard navigation. Account for different screens and loading, empty, and
  error states as required by the functionality.
- Avoid unnecessary repeated work and resource access. Measure performance
  problems before introducing optimizations that increase complexity.

## 11. Verification

- Before finishing, check that every changed file remains faithful to its name
  and context, contracts remain consistent, and there are no circular
  dependencies or mixed responsibilities.
- Test observable behavior and relevant rules, including failure and boundary
  cases proportional to risk. For bug fixes, add a regression test when there
  is a reproducible scenario and useful automated coverage.
- Avoid tests that merely mirror implementation, internal details, or trivial
  changes without significant risk.
- Run tests, static analysis, formatting checks, and builds applicable to the
  change using existing project tools. Do not claim checks you did not run;
  report limitations and remaining failures.
- Explicitly list relevant tests that could not be executed, explain why, and
  describe the resulting validation gap.

## 12. Language

- Write all code, variable names, functions, classes, file names, comments,
  docstrings, and documentation in English, including this file and changelogs.
- Communicate with the developer in Brazilian Portuguese, including progress
  updates, explanations, and approval requests. Preserve English text when
  presenting proposed commit messages or documentation excerpts.
- Write all Git commit messages, including their bodies, in English.

## 13. Existing Architecture

- Follow the existing project architecture and established conventions while
  preserving the context boundaries and single-responsibility rules above.
- Inspect the relevant contexts and integration points before implementing a
  change. Extend existing modules and contracts when their responsibilities fit.
- Do not introduce a competing architecture or reorganize unrelated contexts
  within a feature or bug fix. If the current structure conflicts with these
  rules, make the smallest necessary extraction in the affected context and
  explain the decision to the developer.

## 14. Language-Specific Code Quality

- For Python, follow PEP 8 and the project's configured formatter and linter.
  Prefer type hints for function parameters, return values, and data contracts.
- For JavaScript and TypeScript, follow the project's configured formatter and
  linter. Reuse existing configuration rather than introducing competing tools
  or unrelated formatting changes.
- For TypeScript, prefer strict typing. Avoid implicit or unjustified `any`,
  unsafe assertions, and suppression of type errors. Narrow uncertain values
  before use and preserve existing strict compiler settings. When enabling
  strictness in an existing project requires a broader migration, explain and
  scope that migration separately rather than changing unrelated files.
- Apply language-specific rules only where that language is present; they do
  not require adopting a language or adding tools to unrelated projects.

## 15. Implementation Workflow

- Inspect the existing directory structure, applicable instructions, relevant
  files, and tool configuration before modifying files. Identify the affected
  context and follow its established patterns.
- Explain significant architectural changes to the developer, including the
  reason, affected boundaries, and important tradeoffs.
- Modify only files necessary for the requested change and its validation.
  Preserve unrelated user changes; do not perform opportunistic refactoring,
  renaming, dependency updates, or repository-wide formatting.
- Prefer simple solutions over unnecessary complexity, and verify the affected
  behavior with relevant tests whenever possible. Follow the verification and
  reporting requirements above, including reporting tests that could not run.
